How to use
++++++++++

Have a file named 'greece.csv' (or edit the reference in the code), with at least two columns defined, 'id', and 'comments' in the same directory as the script.

The script should initially run with all arguments to indicate that the data needs to be completely regenerated.  This will take some time and result in a number of JSON files in the same directory as the script.
